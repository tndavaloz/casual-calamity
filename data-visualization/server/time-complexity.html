    <h1>No output - check your console</h1>
    <p>In it, you will find various examples of different algorithms and their time complexities.</p>
    <p>Note that measuring the efficiency of these algorithms in strict time (that is to say, seconds) is imperfect and imprecise. So take the log statements with a grain of salt.</p>
